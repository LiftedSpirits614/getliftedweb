Thank you for being part of the Get Lifted validation process! You have been chosen to be part of this process because you are the type of cannabis user that understands the nuances of the different experiences and different health benefits that cannabis has to offer. For those very reasons, you are the perfect candidate to be part of a process that is helping the Get Lifted team validate their theoretical AI model which is that we can accurately norm how a particular cannabis strain affects a user and therefore help predict the effects it will have on a typical person.

Because we are interested in making a clinically accurate model rather than just a marketing gimmick, we desperately need the following things from you:

- Smoke our weed and get high AF!
- Understand that this is not a school assignment, you don’t need to rack up data quickly and rush through it. We need Accurate information so please take your time and put some thought into your answers. 
- Did we say take your time and answer thoughtfully?

You do not have to give any information that you don’t want to in the background information section of your profile, but the more information you want to provide the better for us and our AI model. People who fill out more information will receive more sample products during subsequent rounds of beta testing.

All of the information provided during this beta testing will be kept confidential according to HIPAA standards and will not have any identifying information kept about the users who provide us data.

By clicking on the I Agree box below you agree to the terms of beta testing agreements including all confidentiality agreements about the beta testing of this software.
